# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results-
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

##Statistical Analysis Scope
Bootstrapping sampling distributions
P-value and Z-score calculation
Logistic regression
##Tools
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy
Jupyter Notebook
